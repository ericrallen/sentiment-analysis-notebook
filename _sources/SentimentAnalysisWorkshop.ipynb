    "While sentiment analysis is sort of like the [\"Hello, world!\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#Variations) of [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP), luckily for us it's a bit more fun than just echoing out a string.\n",

    "[Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is a way of analyzing some text to determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n",

    "\n",

    "   2. **Lemmatization**: uses a morphological analysis of words to reduce them to their root forms\n",

    "3. **Vectorization**: converts the tokens into a id that can be used for comparison\n",
    "4. **Comparison**: compares the tokens to a known set of tokens to determine the sentiment\n",

    "- [**Few Shot**](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot): gives the model a few examples of how we'd like it to respond to different prompts to help guide it's output; this is useful for situations where the model is doing something novel and needs more guidance, and we're going to be mostly focusing on asking the model to perform the task that we're providing examples for\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For other types of tasks there are various prompting strategies that can be useful, like [Chain of Thought Reasoning](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot), [Directional Stimulus Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/dsp), and even telling the model to [take a deep breath](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/telling-ai-model-to-take-a-deep-breath-causes-math-scores-to-soar-in-study/) can help it do math.\n"

    "With the advent of LLMs, like ChatGPT, and the continued discovery of new prompting strategies to guide these models we can quickly perform complex NLP tasks, like sentiment analysis, and teach models to perform novel tasks without the need for retraining.\n",
