# Sentiment Analysis with ChatGPT Workshop

In this interactive workshop powered by a Jupyter Notebook, we'll explore the basics of traditional Sentiment Analysis and how we can expand our sentiment analysis capabilities with ChatGPT and some clever prompting strategies.

## Pre-requisites

1. Python `>=3.11`
2. [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

**Note**: If you are running this notebook locally, it will look for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, but you can also manually enter your OpenAI API key into the notebook.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ericrallen/sentiment-analysis-notebook.git
   ```

2. Change into the directory

   ```shell
   cd sentiment-analysis-notebook
   ```

3. Install the dependencies

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: you can use whatever Python environment manager you prefer.

4. Run the notebook
   ```shell
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Interactive Notebook

This [workshop notebook](https://ericrallen.github.io/sentiment-analysis-notebook/) is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages so you can run it in your browser without installing anything locally.

**Note**: Unfortunately, the `ipywidgets` library used to create interactive demonstrations in the notebook does not seem to cooperate with GitHub Pages, MyBinder, or Google Colab. This is my first Jupyter Notebook, so it's likely that I misconfigured something.
