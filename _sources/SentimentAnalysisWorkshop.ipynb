    "2. **Tokenization**: breaks the text into individual units of meaning called tokens\n",
    "3. **Vectorization**: converts the tokens into a id that can be used for comparison\n",
    "4. **Comparison**: compares the tokens to a known set of tokens to determine the sentiment\n",

    "\n",
    "[Prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) (or \"prompting\" if you are into the whole brevity thing) is the process of creating and testing instructions for the model (called \"prompts\") to find the most concise set of instructions that will guide the model towards returning your desired results as often as possible while minimizing undesired output like [hallucinations](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)>) and [apologies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36949931).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each message you send and each response that you receive become part of the overall prompt for the next message, but there are strategies for managing a conversation's memory in order to selectively exclude messages that might lead to the model getting off track if repeated often enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the overall conversation as a document of text - it can help to imagine it as something like a [screenplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of messages that make up this screenplay:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System**: system messages are sort of like stage directions, they describe the overall parameters that the model should follow and provide any other context that the model might need to know about as the conversation continues\n",
    "- **User**: user messages are the individual prompts that the user sends to the model\n",
    "- **Assistant**: assistant messages are the responses the model generates to the user's prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're just chatting with ChatGPT via it's web-based User Interface (UI), you're probably familiar with **User** and **Assistant** messages, but you may not know that there's a **System** message behind the scenes that helps guide how the model responds to your messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Custom Instructions](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt) are sort of like [system prompts](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts), but don't give us quite as much control as we can exercise via the [Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) - or as much control as we can get with some of the recent open source models.\n",

    "- [**Few Shot**](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot): gives the model a few examples of how we'd like it to respond to different prompts to help guide it's output; this is useful for situations where the model is doing something novel and needs more guidance, and we're going to be mostly focusing on asking the model to perform the task that we're providing examples for\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For other types of tasks there are various prompting strategies that can be useful, like [Chain of Thought Reasoning](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot), [Directional Stimulus Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/dsp), and even telling the model to [take a deep breath](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/telling-ai-model-to-take-a-deep-breath-causes-math-scores-to-soar-in-study/) can help it do math.\n",
