    "# Sentiment Analysis with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is sort of like the \"Hello, world!\" of Natural Language Processing (NLP), but luckily for us, it's a bit more fun than just echoing out a string - otherwise this workshop could be a bit bland.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through analyzing sentiment with ChatGPT and discuss some of the differences between how you can approach this problem with a generative AI like ChatGPT versus how you might have approached this problem in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For a better learning experience, this notebook purposely hides some implementation details like how interactive widgets are created and certain imports of notebook-specific utilities. Full details are available if you open this notebook in your editor of choice or expand the hidden cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a way of analyzing some text to determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the kind of thing that's pretty easy for a human who understands the language the text is written in, but it can be hard for a computer to really understand the underlying meaning behind the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"I saw that movie.\" - Neutral\n",
    "2. \"I love that movie.\" - Positive\n",
    "3. \"I hate that movie.\" - Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we analyze sentiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with some housekeeping first by making sure that our dependencies are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, we'll start out by exploring a more traditional approach that uses the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and then we'll see how our approach might change when we use ChatGPT via the OpenAI SDK instead."

When you click the **Update Key** button the key you entered will be obfuscated and stored in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` global variable.\n",
    "- **Model**: You can choose between the `gtp-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` models for this demo. The `gpt-4` model is more powerful, but it's also slower and more expensive to use.\n",
    "- **Temperature**: A model's temperature is a measure of how \"creative\" or \"unique\" it's response will be. You can set this to `0` for something pretty close to deterministic responses to simple queries.\n",
    "- **Sample Size**: We'll be gathering the top storeis from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and then sending the titles of a sample of those stories to the model for analysis. For quicker, cheaper results you may want to set this to a lower number. The larger your sample, the more tokens that will be consumed and the more likely you are to hit any rate limits"

    "## How Sentiment Analysis Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis, like most text analysis involves a multistep process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stemming / Lemmatization**: reduces the words in the text to their root forms to simplify comparison between different forms of the same words\n",
    "   1. **Stemming**: removes suffixes as an attempt to reduce words to their root forms\n",
    "   2. **Lemmatization**: uses a morphological analysis of words to reduce them to their root forms\n",
    "2. **Tokenization**: breaks the text into individual units of meaning called tokens\n",
    "3. **Vectorization**: converts the tokens into a id that can be used for comparison\n",
    "4. **Comparison**: compares the tokens to a known set of tokens to determine the sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we're taking advantage of an existing model that has been trained to analyze sentiment in text. If we wanted to build our own from scratch, it would be a more complicated process and require training data to feed into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models like those that power ChatGPT, and other transformer models that have exploded in popularity since, we can leverage the powerful inference and predictive capabilities of these models to perform sentiment analysis without having to train our own model, and we can even leverage some prompting techniques to quickly teach the model how to perform more unique analyses."
