# Sentiment Analysis with ChatGPT Workshop

In this interactive workshop powered by a Jupyter Notebook, we'll explore the basics of traditional Sentiment Analysis and how we can expand our sentiment analysis capabilities with ChatGPT and some clever prompting strategies.

## Interactive Notebook

In addition to being available on Binder, this [workshop notebook](https://ericrallen.github.io/sentiment-analysis-notebook/) is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Note**: Unfortunately, the `ipywidgets` library used to create interactive demonstrations in the notebook does not seem to cooperate with GitHub Pages. This is my first Jupyter Notebook, so it's likely that I misconfigured something.

## Pre-requisites

1. Python `>=3.11`
2. [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

**Note**: If you are running this notebook locally, it will look for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, but you can also manually enter your OpenAI API key into the notebook.

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ericrallen/sentiment-analysis-notebook.git
